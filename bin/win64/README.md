Windows 64 bit executables
==========================

`ugrep.exe` offers the same functionality as ugrep described in the documentation.

`ug.exe` is `ugrep.exe` renamed; behaves the same as the ug command (by means of naming it `ug.exe`).

If you want ugrep to emulate GNU grep, then copy `ugrep.exe` to `grep.exe` and to `egrep.exe`, `fgrep.exe`.  

The executables expect and require CPUs supporting SSE2.

The executables detect AVX2/AVX512BW automatically for optimized searching.
