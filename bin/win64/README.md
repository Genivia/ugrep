Windows 64 bit executables
==========================

`ugrep.exe` offers the same functionality as ugrep (and ug when renamed).

`ug.exe` must be created manually by copying `ugrep.exe` to `ug.exe` (it is the same file, but renamed).

If you want ugrep to emulate GNU grep, then copy `ugrep.exe` to `grep.exe` and to `egrep.exe`, `fgrep.exe`.  

The executables detect AVX2/AVX512BW automatically for optimized searching.
